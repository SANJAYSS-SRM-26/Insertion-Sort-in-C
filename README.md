# Insertion-Sort-in-C
This repository contains a simple C program implementing the Insertion Sort algorithm.The Insertion Sort algorithm is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a sorted array one element at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, insertion sort provides several advantages, such as simplicity and the ability to efficiently sort small data sets.

# Usage:
To use and test the insertion sort algorithm with a different array, modify the arr array in the main function of the insertion_sort.c file.

# How to Compile and Run:
Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system.
Open a terminal in the repository's directory.
Compile and Run Code.

# Example:
Input Array: [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
<br>
Sorted Array: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
